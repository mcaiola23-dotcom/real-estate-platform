# TODO_BACKLOG

## Critical / Now
- [x] Create `real-estate-platform` parent repo.
- [x] Copy current Fairfield app to `apps/web`.
- [x] Move/initialize studio as `apps/studio`.
- [x] Add workspace tooling and root scripts.
- [x] Define shared domain and event types.
- [x] Stand up tenant/domain schema.
- [x] Complete tenant context threading through remaining website APIs and data providers.
- [x] Complete tenant context threading through remaining client-side/static data providers.
- [x] Replace seed-backed tenant persistence with durable data store + migrations.

## Next
- [x] Scaffold `apps/admin` control-plane app with protected auth boundary and internal operations dashboard shell.
- [x] Implement shared control-plane db/contracts for tenant provisioning, domain lifecycle management, and plan/feature-flag settings.
- [x] Add tenant provisioning/domain/status API routes in `apps/admin` and connect dashboard mutation flows.
- [x] Add route-level tests for control-plane API validation/guard behavior and happy-path provisioning/domain updates.
- [ ] Execute `@real-estate/admin` route-test command in a compatible local environment (tsx IPC + platform-matched esbuild) and record passing output.
- [ ] Re-run Prisma migrate/seed validation for control-plane schema changes in a network-capable environment (`binaries.prisma.sh` reachable) and confirm migration `202602130004_add_tenant_control_settings` application.
- [ ] Confirm `npm run build --workspace @real-estate/admin` in standard dev environment after resolving sandbox SWC/cache constraints.
- [x] Build tenant resolver middleware by host header.
- [x] Implement website module registry + toggle system.
- [x] Install `@real-estate/db` workspace dependencies and run Prisma generate/migrate/seed locally.
- [x] Create CRM app skeleton and auth integration.
- [x] Build lead/contact/activity database model.
- [x] Add event ingestion pipeline from website actions to CRM.
- [x] Mitigate local Prisma engine file-lock issue impacting `db:generate` reliability on Windows dev environment.
- [x] Build tenant-scoped CRM read/write API routes and dashboard UI modules for leads, contacts, and activity timeline.
- [x] Introduce ingestion service boundary (queue/worker contract) so website APIs enqueue events instead of direct CRM writes.
- [x] Add Prisma config migration (`prisma.config.ts`) and remove deprecated `package.json#prisma` in `@real-estate/db`.
- [x] Expand CRM API filtering/pagination contracts and add route-level validation tests.
- [x] Add CRM API route integration tests for tenant/auth guards, payload validation, pagination responses, and lead status activity side effects.
- [x] Add CRM mutation failure integration coverage for tenant-scoped invalid lead/contact linkage on activity creation.
- [x] Add ingestion worker retry scheduling + dead-letter handling for production reliability.
- [x] Add integration test flow for enqueue -> worker -> CRM persistence (tenant-scoped baseline).
- [x] Add dead-letter lifecycle coverage to ingestion integration flow (invalid payload -> dead-letter -> requeue -> dead-letter).
- [x] Add retry/backoff integration coverage for queue reprocessing cadence (`pending -> processing -> pending` with `nextAttemptAt` gating and attempt count progression).
- [x] Add terminal retry-threshold integration coverage for `ingestion_failed` jobs transitioning to `dead_letter` at max attempts.
- [x] Add dead-letter operator command integration coverage for single-job requeue and tenant-filtered batch requeue paths.
- [x] Add explicit payload validation guard in ingestion path to avoid noisy runtime throws for malformed lead/valuation payloads.
- [x] Add machine-readable JSON output mode for dead-letter operator commands and assert payload shape stability in integration tests.
- [x] Add malformed valuation payload integration coverage to verify retry/backoff and max-attempt dead-letter semantics match malformed lead behavior.
- [x] Add deterministic temporary-tenant fixture lifecycle for ingestion integration test runs to avoid persistent baseline data growth.
- [x] Extract shared ingestion integration test helpers for tenant fixture lifecycle and forced retry progression; refactor integration scripts to consume helper and assert cleanup success.
- [x] Move Prisma client generation/runtime loading to package-local output (`packages/db/generated/prisma-client`) to reduce shared Windows engine lock contention.
- [x] Stabilize Prisma full-engine local generation path on Windows so ingestion scripts can run end-to-end.
- [x] Add dead-letter queue observability + manual re-drive tooling for operations.
