## ⚠️ PRIORITY CONTENT GAPS (MUST ADDRESS FIRST)

The following content is currently placeholder or insufficient and **MUST be updated**:

### 1. NEIGHBORHOOD OVERVIEWS — Currently Too Short

**Problem**: All 69 neighborhood overviews are currently just 1 short generic sentence. This is insufficient.

**Required**: Each neighborhood overview must be **expanded to 3-5 sentences** covering:
- **Character & atmosphere** — What does it feel like to live here?
- **Home types** — Colonial, contemporary, waterfront estates, condos, etc.
- **Lot sizes & density** — Intimate village feel vs. sprawling estates
- **Key features & attractions** — Parks, beaches, shops, restaurants, marinas, golf courses
- **Lifestyle fit** — Who thrives here? Families, professionals, retirees, commuters?

**Example of CURRENT (too short):**
> "Exclusive waterfront peninsula with stunning Long Island Sound views and private beaches."

**Example of REQUIRED (expanded):**
> "Long Neck Point is one of Darien's most exclusive waterfront enclaves, a private peninsula extending into Long Island Sound with panoramic water views in nearly every direction. Properties here are predominantly estate-scale homes on generous lots, many with private docks, tennis courts, and direct beach access. The neighborhood offers an exceptionally private, resort-like atmosphere while remaining just minutes from downtown Darien's shops and restaurants. Long Neck Point attracts buyers seeking the pinnacle of coastal Connecticut living—those who value privacy, water access, and proximity to Manhattan without sacrificing space or exclusivity."

### 2. TOWN & NEIGHBORHOOD HIGHLIGHTS — Currently Blank/Generic

**Problem**: The "Highlights" section for ALL towns and neighborhoods is currently showing:
- "Highlights coming soon" placeholder text
- OR completely blank
- OR generic placeholder bullets

**Required**: Every town and neighborhood needs **custom highlight bullet points** with SPECIFIC local details.

**Town Highlights** — 5-7 bullets per town covering:
- Metro-North commute times to Grand Central
- Specific school names and rankings
- Named beaches, parks, nature preserves
- Downtown/village amenities (specific restaurant districts, shopping areas)
- Notable clubs, cultural institutions
- Unique geographic or architectural features

**Neighborhood Highlights** — 3-5 bullets per neighborhood covering:
- Proximity to specific amenities (named parks, beaches, schools)
- Architectural character (historic colonials, mid-century moderns, new construction)
- Community features (beach clubs, tennis associations, walking trails)
- Commute specifics (distance to train station, highway access)

**Examples of BAD highlights (generic):**
- ❌ "Great schools"
- ❌ "Easy commute"
- ❌ "Beautiful homes"
- ❌ "Family-friendly"

**Examples of GOOD highlights (specific):**
- ✓ "Darien High School consistently ranked in Connecticut's top 10 public high schools"
- ✓ "Express Metro-North service to Grand Central in 48 minutes"
- ✓ "Private resident beach access at Weed Beach and Pear Tree Point"
- ✓ "Walking distance to Palmer's Market and downtown Darien shops"
- ✓ "Mix of classic New England colonials and architect-designed contemporary homes"
- ✓ "Tokeneke Club offers tennis, swimming, and summer sailing programs"

## COPYWRITING TASKS

### Task 1: Town Page Content (9 towns)

For each town, create/revise:

**A. Overview (Short)** - 2-3 sentences for hero/preview
**B. About {Town}** - 2-3 paragraphs, general character and appeal
**C. Living in {Town}** - 2-3 paragraphs about lifestyle, community, daily life
**D. Real Estate in {Town}** - 2-3 paragraphs about market character (personalized to Matt)
**E. Highlights** - 5-7 bullet points with SPECIFIC local details (not generic)

**Towns requiring content:**
1. Darien (existing content needs personalization + highlights)
2. Fairfield (existing content needs personalization + highlights)
3. Greenwich (existing content needs personalization + highlights)
4. Westport (existing content needs personalization + highlights)
5. New Canaan (needs all content)
6. Norwalk (needs all content)
7. Ridgefield (needs all content)
8. Stamford (needs all content)
9. Wilton (needs all content)

**CRITICAL Personalization Requirement**: 

Do NOT simply find/replace "a local agent" with "Matt Caiola" word-for-word. The sentences must be **completely reworked** to:
1. Position Matt as THE qualified, preferred agent for the job
2. Highlight his unique qualifications (finance background, investment experience, local expertise)
3. Create persuasive copy that wins business
4. Maintain first-person voice where appropriate

**Examples:**

❌ BAD (simple replacement):
"Working with a knowledgeable local agent helps buyers understand current conditions."
→ "Working with Matt Caiola helps buyers understand current conditions." (WRONG - lazy)

✓ GOOD (reworked to sell):
"With my background in finance and years of experience investing in Fairfield County real estate, I bring a level of market insight that helps buyers make confident, data-informed decisions. I don't just show homes—I help you understand what you're really buying."

❌ BAD:
"Your agent can help you navigate the market."

✓ GOOD:
"I take a hands-on approach to guiding clients through every step of the process. My clients appreciate that I'm not just their agent—I'm an investor myself who understands what it means to make a significant real estate decision."

**The goal is persuasive, credibility-building copy that makes readers want to work with Matt specifically.**

**E. Highlights** — ⚠️ CURRENTLY BLANK/PLACEHOLDER — MUST CREATE

Every town MUST have 5-7 custom highlights. These are currently showing "Highlights coming soon" or generic placeholders.

**Highlights format** (be SPECIFIC, not generic):
- ❌ "Easy commute to NYC"
- ✓ "Express Metro-North service to Grand Central (48 minutes from Greenwich station)"
- ❌ "Great schools"
- ✓ "Top-rated public schools including Darien High School, consistently ranked among Connecticut's best"
- ❌ "Beautiful beaches"
- ✓ "Weed Beach and Pear Tree Point Beach offer resident-only access with swimming, kayaking, and summer programs"
- ❌ "Great downtown"
- ✓ "Walkable downtown along Post Road featuring Palmer's Market, local boutiques, and restaurants like Ten Twenty Post"

### Task 2: Neighborhood Content (~69 neighborhoods) — ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**CRITICAL**: Current neighborhood content is placeholder-quality and MUST be substantially expanded.

For each neighborhood, create:

**A. Overview** — **3-5 DETAILED sentences** (NOT 1 short sentence!)

The overview appears on preview cards and is the first impression. It must include:
- **Atmosphere/character** — What makes this neighborhood unique?
- **Home styles** — Types of properties (colonials, contemporaries, waterfront, condos)
- **Lot characteristics** — Size, density, landscaping, topography
- **Key attractions** — Parks, beaches, shops, restaurants, clubs within/near the neighborhood
- **Lifestyle match** — Who lives here? Families, professionals, empty-nesters, commuters?
- **Location context** — Proximity to downtown, train stations, major amenities

**Example of INSUFFICIENT overview (current state):**
> "Charming village with harbor views, antique shops, and tree-lined streets."

**Example of REQUIRED overview (expanded):**
> "Southport is one of Fairfield County's most picturesque villages, a historic harbor community where tree-lined streets are dotted with antique shops, galleries, and acclaimed restaurants. Properties range from meticulously restored 18th-century colonials to grand waterfront estates overlooking Southport Harbor. The neighborhood centers on Pequot Avenue, where residents enjoy walkable access to boutiques, the historic Southport Congregational Church, and seasonal farmers markets. Southport attracts buyers who appreciate architectural heritage, a tight-knit community atmosphere, and the convenience of the Southport Metro-North station for NYC commutes. It's ideal for families and professionals seeking village charm without sacrificing proximity to beaches, schools, and Fairfield's broader amenities."

**B. Description** — 2-4 paragraphs covering:
  - Character and feel of the neighborhood (architecture, landscaping, streets)
  - Housing stock (typical home styles, lot sizes, approximate price ranges where appropriate)
  - Key amenities — NAMED parks, beaches, shops, restaurants, clubs
  - Who it's best suited for (families with young kids, professionals, retirees, etc.)
  - Commute/location advantages (specific distances and times)

**C. Highlights** — 3-5 SPECIFIC bullet points (see Priority section above for examples)

**⚠️ NO GENERIC PLACEHOLDERS**: Every neighborhood must have custom, locally-specific highlights. If you don't have specific information about a neighborhood, research it or note it for follow-up rather than using generic filler.

**Neighborhood list by town (69 total):**

**Darien (5):** Downtown Darien, Long Neck Point, Noroton, Noroton Heights, Tokeneke
